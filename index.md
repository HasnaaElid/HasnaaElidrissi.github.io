    <span class="badge">Imbalanced Data</span>
    <span class="badge">Python</span>
    <span class="badge alt">Model Evaluation</span>
  </div>
  Applied machine learning to detect fraudulent transactions in a highly imbalanced dataset (≈0.13% positive class) with a focus on practical precision/recall trade-offs.

  **Outcome / Impact**
  - Random Forest balanced high precision with strong recall for real-world use.
  - Clear evaluation pipeline (PR/ROC, confusion matrix, threshold sensitivity).
  - Communicated operational trade-offs to minimize false positives.

### Note:
I am including eight projects in my portfolio instead of ten. Several earlier course assignments were exploratory exercises or small code demonstrations rather than complete, portfolio-ready projects. The eight listed here represent full, end-to-end work that best demonstrates my applied data science skills across analytics, NLP, big data, and data storytelling.
