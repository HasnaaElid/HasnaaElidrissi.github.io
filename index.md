## 🔹 Featured Projects {#projects}

**From Victim to Defender: Predictive Analytics for Fraud Detection**  
Applied machine learning to detect fraudulent transactions in an imbalanced dataset.  
- **EDA:** Explored transaction type distributions, fraud class imbalance (0.13%), and feature importance.  
- **Techniques:** Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting  
- **Results:** Random Forest achieved 96% precision and 78% recall, balancing fraud detection with minimizing false positives.  
- **Impact:** Demonstrated practical ML trade-offs for high-stakes fraud detection.

**Early Warning NLP for Fraud Signals** *(in progress)*  
Developing an NLP pipeline to surface early indicators of fraud from transaction memos and customer complaints.  
- **EDA:** Keyword frequency analysis, clustering of risk terms, and visualization of emerging fraud-related patterns.  
- **Techniques so far:** Weak supervision, TF-IDF embeddings, scikit-learn, spaCy, SHAP  
- **Findings so far:** Detected early clusters of terms such as “not authorize,” “fraudulent charges,” and “did not” that strongly correlate with disputed transactions.  
- **Next steps:** Refine models with larger datasets, improve interpretability, and extend into multimodal approaches (e.g., image/document analysis) to capture more complex fraud patterns.

**Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Reviews**  
Analyzed customer reviews to predict star ratings and extract actionable insights for e-commerce.  
- **EDA:** Explored rating skew (5-star dominance), frequent positive/negative words, and time trends.  
- **Techniques:** TF-IDF, sentiment scoring, SMOTE for imbalance, Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression  
- **Results:** Random Forest achieved 77% accuracy and 0.89 ROC-AUC, with sentiment scores and helpfulness ratios as top predictors.  
- **Impact:** Showed how ML can help businesses track satisfaction, address complaints, and refine strategy.

**Childcare Affordability & Workforce Participation**  
Investigated the relationship between childcare costs and maternal labor force participation using U.S. Department of Labor data.  
- **EDA:** Normalized affordability ratios, compared across states, and visualized participation trends.  
- **Techniques:** Data wrangling, affordability metrics, Tableau/Power BI dashboards  
- **Results:** Higher childcare costs linked to lower female workforce participation.  
- **Impact:** Framed results as policy recommendations, highlighting economic and social implications.  

---

**Real-Time Fraud Detection & AML Architecture**  
Designed a high-level big data architecture for real-time fraud detection and AML compliance in global banking.  
- **Data Sources:** Raw transactions, rule-based scoring, analytics and search layers  
- **Technologies:** HDFS, Hive, HBase, Spark, Kafka, NiFi, Solr  
- **Outcome:** Proposed scalable ingestion, storage, and detection pipelines to improve compliance and fraud monitoring at scale.  
- **Impact:** Demonstrated ability to design enterprise-ready data pipelines beyond analysis and modeling.
