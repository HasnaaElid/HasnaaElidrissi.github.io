# From Victim to Defender: Predictive Analytics for Fraud Detection

Applied machine learning to detect fraudulent transactions in a highly imbalanced dataset (â‰ˆ0.13% fraud).  

## ðŸ”¹ Techniques
- Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression
- Class imbalance handling
- Evaluation: Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC

## ðŸ”¹ Findings
- Random Forest balanced **96% precision** with **78% recall**
- Fraud concentrated in **cash-out** and **payment** transactions
- Fraud often involved **smaller amounts** (exploiting low-value blind spots)

## ðŸ”¹ Visuals
- Confusion matrix
- Fraud vs. non-fraud histograms
- ROC/PR curves

## ðŸ”¹ Impact
- Practical trade-offs for real-world deployment
- Showed how ML can minimize false positives while catching high-risk cases
