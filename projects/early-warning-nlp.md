# Early Warning NLP for Fraud Signals 

Building an NLP pipeline to surface early indicators of fraud from transaction memos and customer complaints.  

## 🔹 Work Done So Far
- Keyword frequency analysis & clustering
- TF-IDF embeddings, weak supervision
- Identified early risk terms: *“not authorized”*, *“fraudulent charges”*

## 🔹 Next Steps
- Refine with larger datasets
- Add interpretability (e.g., SHAP)
- Explore multimodal data (e.g., images, documents)

## 🔹 Impact
- Supports **proactive fraud monitoring**
- Detects **risk signals earlier** than manual review
