**Repository:** [fraud-early-warning-nlp](https://github.com/HasnaaElid/fraud-early-warning-nlp)

> Detecting early indicators of fraud and scam activity from CFPB consumer complaint narratives using weak labeling and lightweight text models.

---

## Summary
Early-Warning NLP is an applied machine learning pipeline that identifies Account Takeover, Zelle/P2P, Card-Not-Present, and Phishing signals in consumer complaint narratives.  
It combines weak supervision, TF-IDF + Logistic Regression, and precision-based model evaluation to highlight text-based risk signals.

**Skills demonstrated:** Python · NLP · Weak Supervision · Model Evaluation · Data Visualization  

---

## Key Outputs
- TF-IDF baselines with 0.75 target precision  
- Confusion matrices and precision-recall curves  
- Daily trend visualizations of labeled topics  
- Privacy-safe pseudonymization (HMAC tokens)

---

## Lessons Learned
Simple, interpretable models can offer actionable insights in high-stakes financial contexts.  
Weak labels can produce strong early-warning signals when applied carefully.
